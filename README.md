# Relius QMU v0.1.0-alpha1
### A Quest Management Utility application used for managing the Oculus Quest
Relius QMU is a toolkit full of useful utilities that help in managing the Oculus Quest through the use of the Android Debug Bridge.

##### Features:

* Sideload folders or apk files into your Oculus Quest.
* View your device information such as storage information or serial.
* Manage dependencies such as drivers needed for the ADB connection.

### The future of this project
I plan to manage this project part-time and thus updates should be pushed regularly. It will develop over-time and by the time it is finished it will be packed with features and able to be used for future Oculus Quest devices.

##### Future possible upcoming features

* Queue multiple files to install with an install queue.
* Send custom ADB commands to your device.
* Package manager to manage packages installed on the device.
* Snapshot manager to take snapshots of current installed packages, game files and an ability to restore them.
* ADB quick-commands toolkit such as resolution, refresh rate.
* Backup to backup game saves and restore them.
